# Tag different file types #

One usage scenario is to tag file types with images. For example, user can put little Duke in bottom-right corner for all java files:

![http://idea-sexyeditor.googlecode.com/files/duke.jpg](http://idea-sexyeditor.googlecode.com/files/duke.jpg)

Note that in this example Duke image is a PNG image with transparent area around the Dukes figure. Therefore, opacity of the image may be set to be high, e.g. 80% - 100%.
